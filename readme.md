# DevMap - Where are the dev seeking for a job?

## Description

This is a web application that allows users to create a profile and share their location with other developers. Users can also view other
developers' profiles and locations. This only private data required is the user's email address. This email address is used to create a
unique user account, activate/deactivate your status (open to work or not) and is not shared with other users. It will be encrypted in the
database. Your location is shared with other users and is not encrypted. Only a zipcode is asked for and is used to display your location on
a map.
