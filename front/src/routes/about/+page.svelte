		<h1>🎉 Welcome to DevMap 🌍</h1>
		<p>
			DevMap is a web application that aims to change a bit the way developers connect with opportunities. It serves as a global platform where developers who are open to work are displayed on an interactive map. 🗺️
		</p>
		<p>
			With just a click on a pinpoint, you can discover a developer's username, their area of expertise (be it frontend, backend, or fullstack), and their tech stack. 🚀 Our mission is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date visual representation of the developer market.
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe in the power of community and collective growth. That's why we're inviting all developers to join us and make this platform as diverse and inclusive as possible. The more the merrier! 🎈
		</p>
		<p>
			DevMap is built with the innovative Svelte framework for the frontend and the robust Symfony for the backend. We're committed to delivering a seamless and user-friendly experience. 💻
		</p>
		<p>
			But that's not all! We're excited to announce that we're making DevMap a public project. This means that we're opening the doors for developers around the world to contribute, add new features, and help us improve. Together, we can make DevMap better! 🌟
		</p>
		<p>
			So why wait? Join us on this exciting journey today. Let's map out the future of development together with DevMap! 🎊
